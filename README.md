# RF Scalp v1.3 — XAU/USD 5-Minute Scalping Bot

> **Deployed on Railway · OANDA API · Telegram Alerts**

RF Scalp v1.3 is an automated gold scalping bot for XAU/USD built on top of the RF v2.4 infrastructure.
It replaces the CPR breakout strategy with a three-layer scalping signal engine:
**EMA 9/21 crossover** as the primary trigger, **Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** as momentum confirmation,
and **CPR pivot bias** as a directional filter.

## Strategy Overview

RF Scalp v1.3 operates on **M5 (5-minute) candles** and runs a 5-minute cycle.
Every cycle the signal engine evaluates three independent components and scores them.
A trade is only placed when the combined score reaches the configured threshold (default: 4/6).

### The Three Layers

**Layer 1 — EMA 9/21 Crossover (Primary Signal)**
- Uses Exponential Moving Averages on completed M5 candles (excludes the live candle)
- A **fresh cross** (EMA9 just crossed EMA21 in the last two candles) scores +3
- An **aligned but no fresh cross** (EMA9 above/below EMA21) scores +1
- Direction is set entirely by this layer — BUY when EMA9 above EMA21, SELL when below

**Layer 2 — Opening Range Breakout (Momentum Filter)**
- The ORB is defined as the first completed M15 candle at or after session open
- London ORB: first M15 candle from 16:00 SGT (08:00 GMT)
- US ORB: first M15 candle from 21:00 SGT (13:00 GMT)
- Price breaking above ORB high (BUY) or below ORB low (SELL) scores +2
- ORB is cached per session per SGT day in `orb_cache.json`
- If ORB has not yet formed (within 15 minutes of session open), this layer scores 0

**Layer 3 — CPR Pivot Bias (Directional Filter)**
- Daily CPR (Central Pivot Range) levels are fetched from OANDA and cached per SGT day
- Price above CPR pivot on a BUY signal scores +1
- Price below CPR pivot on a SELL signal scores +1
- CPR is a bias filter only — it cannot block a trade, only reduce the score

## Signal Scoring

### Scoring Table

| Component | Condition | Score |
|---|---|---|
| EMA Cross | Fresh EMA9 cross above/below EMA21 | +3 |
| EMA Cross | EMA9/21 aligned but no fresh cross | +1 |
| ORB | Price breaks session ORB high (BUY) / low (SELL) | +2 |
| CPR Bias | Price on correct side of daily pivot | +1 |
| Exhaustion | Price stretched >2× ATR from EMA midpoint | −1 |

**Maximum score: 6**

### Score-to-Action Table

| Score | Action | Position Size |
|---|---|---|
| 5 – 6 | Trade — Full size | $100 |
| 3 – 4 | Trade — Partial size | $66 |
| < 4 | No trade — Watch | $0 |

### Mandatory Blockers (trade is skipped regardless of score)

- Score below session threshold (default: 4)
- R:R ratio < 1:2
- Spread above session limit (London: 130 pips, US: 130 pips)
- News event within ±30 minutes
- Daily loss cap reached (3 losses/day)
- Session loss sub-cap reached (2 losses/session)
- Active cooldown period (30 min after loss streak)
- Friday cutoff (23:00 SGT)

## Trading Sessions

| Session | SGT Time | GMT Equivalent | Max Trades |
|---|---|---|---|
| London Window | 16:00 – 20:59 | 08:00 – 13:00 | 4 |
| US Window | 21:00 – 00:59 | 13:00 – 17:00 EDT | 4 |
| Dead Zone | 01:00 – 15:59 | — | 0 (no new entries) |

The Asian session is **disabled** — XAU/USD does not produce sufficient momentum for
scalp-quality ORB breakouts or clean EMA crosses during Asian hours.

## Risk Management

### Stop Loss
- Mode: `pct_based` (default)
- SL = 0.15% of entry price
- At gold price of ~$2,400: SL ≈ $3.60 per unit
- Clamped: min $2.00, max $8.00 (ATR mode)

### Take Profit
- Mode: `rr_multiple` (default)
- TP = SL × RR ratio (default 2.5)
- Effective TP ≈ 0.35% of entry
- At gold price of ~$2,400: TP ≈ $8.40 per unit

### Comparision: RF v2.4 vs RF Scalp v1.3

| Parameter | RF v2.4 | RF Scalp v1.3 |
|---|---|---|
| SL % | 0.25% | 0.15% |
| TP % | 0.75% | 0.35% |
| RR ratio | 3.0 | 2.5 |
| Signal timeframe | M15 | M5 |
| Strategy | CPR breakout | EMA + ORB + CPR bias |

### Daily Limits (same as RF v2.4)

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Max trades per day | 8 |
| Max losing trades per day | 3 |
| Max losing trades per session | 2 |
| Loss streak cooldown | 30 minutes |

## Railway Deployment

### First Deploy

1. Push the `RF Scalp v1.3` folder to a new GitHub repository
2. In Railway: **New Project → Deploy from GitHub Repo**
3. Select the repository
4. Add all environment variables (see below)
5. Railway auto-detects `Procfile` and starts the bot

### Procfile

```
